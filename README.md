# GIS Land Suitability Analysis - City of Boston

This project is part of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2021, and focuses on creating an open-source GIS Land Suitability Analysis as part of a larger Regional Catastrophic Grant Program (RCGP) by FEMA.

Disaster Housing has been chosen as the capability gap to focus on. As part of this process, a Jupyter notebook had been built for others to utilize when creating their own disaster housing plan. It includes an open-source GIS land suitability analysis inspired by work completed by the Hurricane Matthew Disaster Recovery and Resilience Initiative.
